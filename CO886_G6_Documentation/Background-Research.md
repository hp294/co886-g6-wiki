• Heat currently has no interfaces to cope with users who have a visual disability or who are blind. Heat does however 
  allow the user to increase the font size from between size 10 and 24 in both the editor and interpreter window.   
• A user story is to be able to read and see text clearer.   
• Fonts define the look of text. The two primary elements in this definition are type of font and their size.  
• The BBC in their fact sheet [Vision Impairment and Computing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/guides/factsheets/factsheet_vision_computing.pdf) discuss the recommended font types for the visually impaired. They recommend using sans-serif fonts because they have no tails. It is also recommended to use a font that has a uniform line width. One such font recommended is Arial. It stands to reason that increasing the font size will benefit those who are visually impaired.
