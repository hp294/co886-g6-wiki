**Colour & Contrast**    
• Some visually impaired users may have difficulty distinguishing between certain colours. The most common types of colour blindness are red-green, blue-yellow and complete colour blindness (monochromacy)[1]. People with red-green colour blindness – the most common variant, may see red as black or brown, which may make red text and components difficult to see clearly, particularly when used against a dark background. This suggests removing red from the program would be beneficial to some colour-blind users.<br>
• Google Accessibility offers a chrome extension that tries to improve web-browsing for the visually impaired[2]. The available adjustments include “invert colour”, which generally changes a webpage background to black as most websites offer a predominantly white background. Another adjustment is “increased contrast” which heightens the contrast between colours. These are two adjustments that could be implemented into the HEAT application.

**Cursor Visibility**  
• Many people with poor vision find it difficult to locate the text cursor. It makes sense to make the cursor bigger and a block shape in order to see it better[7].  
• Since the background is going to be black, it makes sense for the caret cursor to be white in order to stand out as much as possible.  
• To change the size or type of a caret you need to create a custom caret class which is extended from the default caret class [5].

**Font Visibility**  
• Heat currently has no interfaces to cope with users who have a visual disability or who are blind. Heat does however 
  allow the user to increase the font size from between size 10 and 24 in both the editor and interpreter window.   
• A user story is to be able to read and see text clearer.   
• Fonts define the look of text. The two primary elements in this definition are type of font and their size.  
• The BBC in their fact sheet [Vision Impairment and Computing][3] discuss the recommended font types for the visually impaired. They recommend using sans-serif fonts because they have no tails. It is also recommended to use a font that has a uniform line width. One such font recommended is Arial. It stands to reason that increasing the font size will benefit those who are visually impaired.  

**Sound Effect**  
• Sound effects can be an effective method of signalling events to a user. For the visually impaired this means that they are alerted immediately that an issue has occurred, and also can help to make the experience more entertaining, rather than having the difficulty to realise that an error has occurred solely by vision.
• Sound effects can warn a user to take some form of action [4].
•  Suitable sound effects should that are expected to trigger regularly should be kept short in duration [5].
• There is website for free sounds which are royalty free and are freely usable in any applications - www.freesounds.org.
