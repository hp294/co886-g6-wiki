**Colour & Contrast**    
• Some visually impaired users may have difficulty distinguishing between certain colours. The most common types of colour blindness are red-green, blue-yellow and complete colour blindness (monochromacy)[1]. People with red-green colour blindness – the most common variant, may see red as black or brown, which may make red text and components difficult to see clearly, particularly when used against a dark background. This suggests removing red from the program would be beneficial to some colour-blind users.<br>
• Google Accessibility offers a chrome extension that tries to improve web-browsing for the visually impaired[2]. The available adjustments include “invert colour”, which generally changes a webpage background to black as most websites offer a predominantly white background. Another adjustment is “increased contrast” which heightens the contrast between colours. These are two adjustments that could be implemented into the HEAT application.


**Font Visibility**  
• Heat currently has no interfaces to cope with users who have a visual disability or who are blind. Heat does however 
  allow the user to increase the font size from between size 10 and 24 in both the editor and interpreter window.   
• A user story is to be able to read and see text clearer.   
• Fonts define the look of text. The two primary elements in this definition are type of font and their size.  
• The BBC in their fact sheet [Vision Impairment and Computing][3] discuss the recommended font types for the visually impaired. They recommend using sans-serif fonts because they have no tails. It is also recommended to use a font that has a uniform line width. One such font recommended is Arial. It stands to reason that increasing the font size will benefit those who are visually impaired.
