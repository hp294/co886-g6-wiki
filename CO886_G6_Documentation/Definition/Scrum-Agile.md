**Scrum Team** (1 tester, 1 UX designer, multiple developers), Scrum Master, Product Owner. Self organised team, responsible for picking tasks tasks in sprint.  
**Product Owner** represents customer, understands product vision & its business value, produces product backlog, prioritisation, user stories grooming.  
**Scrum Master** is the scrum coach, and make sure the team can focus on their goal within a sprint.

***THE SCRUM MODEL***: completing a project via a series of sprints. Each spint are often done in 2 weeks.
The Product Backlog is the complete list of features to be built (written in the form of user stories, which are short descriptions of functionality described from the perspective of a user or customer). The product owner prioritises the backlog so the team always works on the most valuable features first.

**Sprint Planning** happens at the start of the sprint, where team members figure out how many items they can commit to, and then create a sprint backlog – a list of the tasks to perform during the sprint. During the sprint, the scrum team takes a small set of features from idea to coded and tested functionality, and integrated into the evolving product or system.

**On each day of the sprint**: all team members attend a Daily Scrum meeting, including the ScrumMaster and the product owner. This meeting is timeboxed to no more than 15 minutes. During that time, team members share what they worked on the prior day, will work on that day, and identify any impediments to progress. 

**At the end of a sprint**: the team conducts a Sprint review during which the team demonstrates the new functionality to the PO or any other stakeholder who wishes to provide feedback that could influence the next sprint. 

**Sprint retrospective** at the end of each sprint. The whole team participates in this meeting, including the Scrum Master and PO. The meeting is an opportunity to reflect on the sprint that has ended, and identify opportunities to improve.
