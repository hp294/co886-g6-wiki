There are 3 primary Scrum Artifacts:

| Artifacts | Definition | Goal - Transparency | Goal - Shared Understanding |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Product Backlog | Ordered list of everything customer might want the development team to work on, related to the product under development | Single ordered list | Collaborative Refinement |
| Sprint Backlog | Development team's plan for how they will deliver the Sprint Goal and related Product Backlog items during the current Sprint | Real-time picture of all work in current Sprint | Collaborated created by Development Team, Regularly updated during Sprint |  
| Product Increment | The sum of all completed Product Backlog items in a given Sprint plus the values of previous Increments | Done Product every Sprint  | Usable by Stakeholders |  

**Definition of Done**: When the Product Increment is delivered, it needs to meet “Definition of Done” which is a shared understanding document of the development team regarding of what “done” means. This definition is different for every Scrum Team, and as the team matures, the Definition of Done will expand and become more stringent.
