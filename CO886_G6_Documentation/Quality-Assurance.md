**Test Plan for the HEAT Accessibility Function**<br>

**1. Objectives**<br>

**1.1 Purpose**<br>
This document details the plan for testing the extended accessibility functions for the HEAT application. The document supports the following objectives:<br>
*  Identify the areas marked for testing.<br>
*  List the recommended test requirements.<br>
*  Recommend and describe the testing strategies to be employed.<br>

**1.2 Testing Scope**<br>
This plan assumes that the HEAT application has already undergone extensive testing procedures. Therefore testing will be limited to the components within the system that have been extended for improved accessibility for visually-impaired users.<br>

The system components to be tested are:<br>

1.  Colour and contrast within the editor,console and tree window.<br>
2. Sound effects denoting success and failure with regard to command execution and program compilation.<br>
3. Icon size.<br>
4. Font size and font type.<br>

The critical performance measures to test are:<br>

1. Functionality of colour and contrast changes within the system.<br>
2. User response to colour and contrast modification.<br>
3. Functionality of implemented sound effects.<br>
4. User response to sound effects.<br>
5. Functionality of increased icon size implementation.<br>
6. User response to modified icon size.<br>
7. Functionality of increased font size and font type implementation.<br>
8. User response to modified font size and type.<br>
