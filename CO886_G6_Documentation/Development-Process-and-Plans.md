* <b>Allocation of tasks</b>: [Commits to Master Branch](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/graphs/master) and [All Tasks](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all)

* <b>Issue Tracking</b> & <b>Issue Triage</b>: Each issue is added to the [Issue List](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/issues) where we set weight, priority and relevant label to the nature of the issue. Weight, Difficulty labels as well as Label Priority are used to prioritise the list.   

* <b>Version control</b>: The team follows [GitFlow](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/). Different version of codes are kept in individual branches. Each developer has their own [Branch](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/branches). A [Merge Request](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/commits/master) is created when a developer wants to add their changes to the master branch, which is reviewed before the merge happens. Lead developer is in charge of reviewing the merge requests. Changes made to the master branch can be tracked in [Repository Graph](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/network/master).    

* [<b>Test Plan](./Quality-Assurance) & [<b>Feedback (Test Evaluation)](./Quality-Assurance)
   
* <b>Charts</b>: We wanted to utilise [Milestone Burndown](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/milestones/3) feature on GitLab but it is not accurate due to an existing [GitLab bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/57198). We used Excel instead. *(Please reload or click on the image if it does not load)*![Burn_Down_Chart](uploads/7c0ccd9ed1ed3ac2df91ca9bfb66a2d2/Burn_Down_Chart.PNG)   
We did not close many tasks during the first 2 days as the team was analysing the code and learning how to use GitLab for documenting. This also explained the Open Date difference between the excel chart and GitLab's Issue List as we did not get to log most of the issues we have been working on until Wednesday (13/03).
