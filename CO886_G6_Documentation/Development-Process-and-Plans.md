1. Development Process
   * [<b>Issue Tracking](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/issues) & [<b>Issue Triage](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/issues): Each issue is added to the Issue List where we set weight, priority and with relevant label to the nature of the issue. Weight, Difficulty labels as well as Label Priority are used to prioritise the list. 
   * [<b>Version control](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/network/master): The team follows [GitFlow](https://about.gitlab.com/2014/09/29/gitlab-flow/). Different version of codes are kept in individual branches. Each developer has their own [Branch](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/branches). A [Merge Request](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/commits/master) is created when a developer wants to add their changes to the master branch, which is reviewed before the merge happens. Lead developer is in charge of reviewing the merge requests. The [Changes History](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/network/master) can be viewed in a chart format.    
   * [<b>Test Planning](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/wikis/CO886_G6_Documentation/Quality-Assurance)
   * Feedback
   * [<b>Code Inspection](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/wikis/CO886_G6_Documentation/Quality-Assurance)
   * [<b>Allocation of tasks](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/graphs/master) 
   * <b>Daily Scrum Meeting Minute
   * <b>Artifacts</b>: [Definition](./Definition/Scrum-Agile-Artifacts), [Product Log](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/issues), [Sprint Log](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/milestones/3), Finalised Features.
* Product Backlog & Sprint Backlog: defines work to be done that will add value. 
* Product Increment: Done portion of the product completed in a Sprint.
* Single ordered list: Make Organisational priority transparent to all internal stakeholders of the product
* Single product owner: responsible for the ordering of the product backlog, provides transparency to the organisation about the decision making process used to arrive at the order
* Product backlog is a dynamic artefact, constantly evolving based on what is known at a given point in time.
* Product Owner collaborates with development team to refine the product backlog. Product backlog refinement is an on-going activity 
* Sprint backlog is collaborated created during Sprint Planning  by the Development team. It is their plan for how they will deliver the Sprint Goal and related Product Backlog items during the current Sprint. It is regularly updated during the Sprint as the Development team learn more.
* Product Increment: the sum of all of all completed Product Backlog items in a given Sprint plus the values of previous Increments. Provide an accurate, transparent picture of the state of product. Since Product Increment meets the team's definition of done, it is usable by stakeholders, providing an opportunity for inspection of the current state of the product
 
They share the same goal: Maximise transparency (priority, plan, progress) and promote shared understanding of the work  

2. Plans
   * Methodology: [Scrum Agile](./Definition/Scrum-Agile-Process), [User stories](./User-Stories)    
   * Charts: [Sprint Burndown](https://git.cs.kent.ac.uk/co886/g6/milestones/3)
