The Haskell Educational Advancement Tool (HEAT) is a simple integrated development environment (IDE) for the Haskell programming language, designed for teaching. HEAT incorporates a code editor a console and a file explorer into a single user interface. HEAT is written in Java, and runs on all major platforms.</br>
Visually impaired users have unique requirements with regard to software interfaces, which are not currently met by the HEAT program.  In this paper we discuss the design and implementation of a number of features intended to optimise HEAT for visually impaired users. In chapters two and three we discuss the requirements of visually impaired users and how these requirements guided our feature design. Chapter four outlines the implementation of the new features along with challenges encountered during this process. Chapter five describes the development processes used throughout the project including the involvement of the customer and the division of work amongst the development team. In chapter six we detail the various development tools which were used on the project and how they supported the teamâ€™s work. In chapter 7 we discuss the quality assurance measures taken along with the testing processes carried out by the team. Finally we conclude with general reflections upon the success of the modifications, the challenges faced, and the systems/tools which were most useful in the development process.
